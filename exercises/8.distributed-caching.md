# Nx Distributed Caching

In this exercise you'll get to know the power of nx distributed caching.

## 1. Recap Local Cache

First, let's recap the nxs local cache. It is already enabled by default and you can confirm
by taking a look at your `nx.json`. In the `targetDefaults` section, you'll find `cache: true`.

```json
{
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      "cache": true // <-- local cache enabled
    }
  }
}
```

Please do a change in your codebase and run `nx build movies`. It will start the build process for your application.
After it is finished, repeat the step.

You should notice the build is running significantly faster than before.
Your terminal should output the following statement:

`> nx run movies:build:production  [existing outputs match the cache, left as is]`

## 2. Distributed Caching

Local cache is cool, however, your team & your infrastructure will still build the very
same artifacts over and over again. We can mitigate this issue by sharing
a cache between all stakeholders.

### connect-to-nx-cloud

The first thing we need to do is to connect our workspace to the nx cloud.
In order to do so, you would typically run `nx connect-to-nx-cloud`.

As this would require you to claim this workspace for yourself, we've already prepared this step for.
The only thing that you need to do is to put the following accessToken configuration into the `nx.json`

```json
// nx.json
{
  "nxCloudAccessToken": "MmRkNTQ2YjItYjBkOC00MzI5LTg2ZjYtYTFhMWNmNzQ2YzFlfHJlYWQtd3JpdGU="
}
```

### Create and distribute your cache

Find yourself someone in the room who is willing to be your cache consumer :-).
This part of the exercise is more fun doing with someone else.

Make sure you are on your own branch, otherwise follow the next step.

<details>
  <summary>Create your branch</summary>

You can use the following pattern: `solution/{your-name}`

```bash
git checkout -b solution/{your-name}
```

</details>

Now do changes to your code base and push everything to your branch.

Make sure to perform at least a `nx build movies` run.

You'll notice the outcome of the build is stating some details about the cloud cache.
You'll also find a link that gives you more information about your run.

![nx-cloud-cache](images/nx-cloud-cache.png)

Tell the name of your branch to your partner you've searched before
and let him or her pull your changes. Then they should also perform a build.

```bash
nx build movies
```

You should notice the build on the other computer was instant as the cloud cache delivered the result 
immediately. It'll also give the same detail information about the nx cloud run.

Now you all can follow the link and inspect the dashboard :-)



### In case git push is not working

Please check out the following branch we've prepared for you:

```bash
git checkout origin 4am
```

Your trainer should have pushed new changes to this branch right when the exercise started.
Please perform the following operations on your client and visit the output:

```bash

nx build movies
nx test movies
nx lint movies

```

The tasks should immediately finish and you'll be informed about a cache hit in nx cloud. 
Please follow the link and inspect the nx cloud dashboard.
