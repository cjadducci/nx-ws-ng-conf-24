# Nx Dependency Checks

In this exercise you'll learn how to enforce architecture constraints. We will use the built-in eslint rule `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries`
in order to configure how libraries are allowed to depend on each other.

# 1. Setup @nx/dependency-checks rule

# 2. Adjust project.json lint target

# 3. Run linter

# 4. Create package.json

# 5. Run lint again

# 6. Run lint --fix

# 7. Think about the outcome, what could go wrong here?
